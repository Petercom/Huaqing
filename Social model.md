The Prologue
前言
Nearby the famous Terra-Cotta Warriors, there are many ancient royal palace
ruins. South to Mountain Li and north to Wei River, this area boasts the natural hot
springs. And also it is close to the ancient capital Xi’an, many emperors of dynasties
had built resorts here, the Huaqing Palace is the most spectacular one among them.
在著名的兵马俑附近，有许多古老的皇宫遗址。南依骊山，北临渭河，这
个地区以天然温泉而闻名。由于毗邻古都长安，许多帝王在这里兴建了行宫别苑，
华清宫是其中最壮观的一个。
Huaqing Palace was built in A.D. 747 ordered by Emperor Xuanzong, who is the
seventh emperor of Tang dynasty, the core regions are the imperial baths group.
Nowadays, the royal palace has been rebuilt on the basis of the site and the royal
baths are excavated and protected. In the imperial baths museum, tourists can see the
remaining five bath sites, which include Star Pool, Prince Pool, Shangshi pool,
Crabapple Flower Pool, and Lotus Flower Pool.
华清宫由唐宣宗皇帝下令修建，于公元747 年建成，核心区域为皇室浴室群。
如今，基于古迹的基础上皇宫已经被重建，古代皇家浴室被挖掘和保护。如今，
在这个皇家浴室博物馆中，游客可以看到遗存的五个浴场，包括星辰汤、太子汤、
尚食汤、海棠汤和莲花汤。
The first imperil relics group, which were built in A.D. 644, includes Star Pool,
Prince Pool, and Shangshi pool. The Star Pool firstly was used by Emperor Taizong,
who is the second emperor of Tang dynasty. The Prince Pool was used by dozens of
the Prince of Tang dynasty. The Shangshi pool was built for senior officials and it was
a great honor to take a bath here. In A.D.747, Emperor Xuanzong ordered to repair
and re-use these facilities.
第一批皇室古迹群，最早是由唐太宗下令修建，建成于公元644 年，包括星
辰汤、太子汤和尚食汤。星辰汤被唐太宗首先使用。太子汤被唐代的数十位太子
先后使用。尚食汤是为当时高级官员建造的，官员在这里沐浴是一种至高的荣誉。
公元747 年，唐玄宗下令修复并再次使用这些设施。

The Second imperil relics group, which were built in A.D.747, includes Lotus
Flower Pool and Crabapple Flower Pool. The two royal baths pools were respectively
used by Emperor Xuanzong and his favorite imperial concubine. The two imperial
pools got the names due to their special shapes. Lotus Flower Pool has been designed
as a lotus, and Crabapple Pool has a shape of blossoming crabapple flower.
第二批皇家古迹群由唐玄宗下令修建，建成于公元747 年，包括莲花汤、海
棠汤两个汤池。两个皇家浴池分别被唐宣宗和杨贵妃分别使用。两个皇家汤池因
其特殊的形状而得名。顾名思义，莲花汤是莲花状，海棠汤是海棠花状。

The five imperial baths embodied the ancient Chinese Confucian culture and
Taoist culture. In the first relics group, Star Pool was previously named as Imperial
Pool and used by Emperor Taizong, hot spring needed to flow through this pool then
to other bath pools, it means that the bathing hot spring had been used by Emperor.
Now it seems a bit ridiculous, but it is reasonable at that time, which expressed the
concept of social hierarchy in Confucian culture. Later, Emperor Xuanzong no longer
used this pool but changed it into a reservoir and renamed it as Star Pool to show
respect for his ancestor, just like the stars need to be looked up for everyone. This
behavior expressed the concept of family hierarchy in Confucian culture.
五个皇室汤池体现了古代中国儒家文化和道教文化。在第一个古迹群中，星
辰汤曾被命名为御汤，为唐太宗所使用。温泉先通过这个汤池，然后到其他汤池，
这意味着温泉已被唐太宗使用。现在看起来有点荒唐，但在当时是合理的，这种
设计体现了中国儒家文化中社会等级的文化。后来，唐玄宗不再使用这个汤池，
而是将其改为蓄水池，并将其更名为星辰，以表达对祖先的尊重，就像天上的星
星，每个人都需要仰望一样。这种设计也体现中国儒家文化中家庭等级的文化。
Shangshi Pool, which was used by senior officials, was well designed. Although
its scale is small, there are three stairs into the pool, means the users were a lot at that
time. Also, each stair has different steps. Officials with higher rank stepped into the
pool through stairs with more steps. From the special structure, it can be found that
the culture of social hierarchy can be reflected from all aspects of society in that era.
高级官员所使用的尚食汤设计也是颇为巧妙。尽管汤池模较小，但是有三处
台阶进入池，可以看出当时的使用人数众多。同时，每个入池台阶的台阶数都有
所不同，而官阶高的官员可以通过台阶多的阶梯缓步入池。从这些特殊的设计，
可以看出社会等级的文化非常深刻，在古代社会的各个方面都时刻体现出来。
In the second relics group, the imperial pools not only were named as the flowers
but also designed as the shapes of flowers. It has a great relationship with the religion
culture. In the Taoism, the palace ’ s name "Huaqing" refers to fairyland and it is
believed that bathing with flower can purify the soul of the bather, especially the lotus
flower, which was the symbol of holiness at that time. By bathing in Huaqing Palace,
Emperor Xuanzong wished to purify his spirit and became a god.
在第二个古迹群中，汤池均以花而命名，而且设计构造液为花朵的形状，这
与当时的宗教文化有很大的关系。华清宫的名称“华清”在道教中，是三清境地
之一，特指仙境。同时，道教认为人在花中沐浴可以净化灵魂，尤其是象征圣洁
的莲花。通过在华清宫沐浴，唐玄宗希望净化其灵魂，达到天人合一的目的。
The design of Lotus Pool is delicate. There are certain curves in the four corners
of the pool’s upper part, which looks like an abstract lotus flower. The lower part of
the pool takes the shape of a regular octagon, and the “eight sides” represent the
eight orientations of the land. The design completely accords with the special growth
rule of the lotus, of which the root is buried under the earth while the flower floats
above the water. Water, earth and flower are closely and indivisibly related with each
other.
莲花汤的设计也很精致。汤池上部的四个角落有一些曲线，看起来像一朵抽
象的莲花。汤池的下半部分形状为八边形，“八面”代表大地的八个方向。这种
设计完全符合莲花独特的生长特性，花浮于水，根植于土。水、土、莲花三种元
素彼此密切相关。
Furthermore, the ancient oriental people believed that the society also can be
divided into three layers, the bottom class, middle class and upper class. Each class
has a clear division and independent function, but the society is a unified whole. This
view can be seemed as the earliest theory of social organism. In the following
chapters, I will combine oriental wisdom with western theories to present an advanced
theory of social organism.
这种设计体现出古人的世界观，类似于莲花的生长结构，社会可以分为三层，
底层、中层和上层。每个阶层都有明确的分工和各自的职能，而社会又是统一兼
容的整体。这个观点可以看作是最早的社会有机体理论。在接下来的文章中，我
将结合东方智慧与西方理论，提出先进的社会有机体论，并详细阐述其合理性。
