The Prologue

Nearby the famous Terra-Cotta Warriors, there are many ancient royal palace
ruins. South to Mountain Li and north to Wei River, this area boasts the natural hot
springs. And also it is close to the ancient capital Xi’an, many emperors of dynasties
had built resorts here, the Huaqing Palace is the most spectacular one among them.

Huaqing Palace was built in A.D. 747 ordered by Emperor Xuanzong, who is the
seventh emperor of Tang dynasty, the core regions are the imperial baths group.
Nowadays, the royal palace has been rebuilt on the basis of the site and the royal
baths are excavated and protected. In the imperial baths museum, tourists can see the
remaining five bath sites, which include Star Pool, Prince Pool, Shangshi pool,
Crabapple Flower Pool, and Lotus Flower Pool.

The first imperil relics group, which were built in A.D. 644, includes Star Pool,
Prince Pool, and Shangshi pool. The Star Pool firstly was used by Emperor Taizong,
who is the second emperor of Tang dynasty. The Prince Pool was used by dozens of
the Prince of Tang dynasty. The Shangshi pool was built for senior officials and it was
a great honor to take a bath here. In A.D.747, Emperor Xuanzong ordered to repair
and re-use these facilities.

The Second imperil relics group, which were built in A.D.747, includes Lotus
Flower Pool and Crabapple Flower Pool. The two royal baths pools were respectively
used by Emperor Xuanzong and his favorite imperial concubine. The two imperial
pools got the names due to their special shapes. Lotus Flower Pool has been designed
as a lotus, and Crabapple Pool has a shape of blossoming crabapple flower.

The five imperial baths embodied the ancient Chinese Confucian culture and
Taoist culture. In the first relics group, Star Pool was previously named as Imperial
Pool and used by Emperor Taizong, hot spring needed to flow through this pool then
to other bath pools, it means that the bathing hot spring had been used by Emperor.
Now it seems a bit ridiculous, but it is reasonable at that time, which expressed the
concept of social hierarchy in Confucian culture. Later, Emperor Xuanzong no longer
used this pool but changed it into a reservoir and renamed it as Star Pool to show
respect for his ancestor, just like the stars need to be looked up for everyone. This
behavior expressed the concept of family hierarchy in Confucian culture.

Shangshi Pool, which was used by senior officials, was well designed. Although
its scale is small, there are three stairs into the pool, means the users were a lot at that
time. Also, each stair has different steps. Officials with higher rank stepped into the
pool through stairs with more steps. From the special structure, it can be found that
the culture of social hierarchy can be reflected from all aspects of society in that era.

In the second relics group, the imperial pools not only were named as the flowers
but also designed as the shapes of flowers. It has a great relationship with the religion
culture. In the Taoism, the palace ’ s name "Huaqing" refers to fairyland and it is
believed that bathing with flower can purify the soul of the bather, especially the lotus
flower, which was the symbol of holiness at that time. By bathing in Huaqing Palace,
Emperor Xuanzong wished to purify his spirit and became a god.

The design of Lotus Pool is delicate. There are certain curves in the four corners
of the pool’s upper part, which looks like an abstract lotus flower. The lower part of
the pool takes the shape of a regular octagon, and the “eight sides” represent the
eight orientations of the land. The design completely accords with the special growth
rule of the lotus, of which the root is buried under the earth while the flower floats
above the water. Water, earth and flower are closely and indivisibly related with each
other.

Furthermore, the ancient oriental people believed that the society also can be
divided into three layers, the bottom class, middle class and upper class. Each class
has a clear division and independent function, but the society is a unified whole. This
view can be seemed as the earliest theory of social organism. In the following
chapters, I will combine oriental wisdom with western theories to present an advanced
theory of social organism.
